# Mancala
Developed a text-based version of the Mancala board game in Python, featuring an interactive gameplay loop for two players. Utilized nested lists and string manipulation to dynamically render the game board, ensuring a clear visual representation of the game state. Implemented essential game mechanics, including valid move checks, stone distribution, and end-of-game conditions, to provide a smooth and accurate gameplay experience.
